## Fashion-Recommendation-System
Welcome to the Fashion Recommender App, a platform that helps you discover similar fashion styles based on an image you upload. This app uses advanced machine learning techniques like ResNet50 for feature extraction and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) for fashion item similarity matching.

### Features:

*   Upload a Fashion Image: Choose a fashion image to find similar styles.
*   Find Similar Styles: Get the top 5 fashion items that are similar to your uploaded image.
*   Powered by AI: Utilizes ResNet50 and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) for accurate recommendations.
*   Simple and User-Friendly: Just upload your image, and the app does the rest!

### How It Works

1.  **Upload an Image:** Select an image of a fashion item (like a dress, shirt, or accessory).
2.  **Processing:** The app preprocesses your image and extracts features using the ResNet50 model.
3.  **Recommendation:** The app then uses k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) to find the 5 most similar fashion items from a precomputed database of fashion images.
4.  **Results:** You’ll see the top 5 recommended fashion items displayed as images.

### Tech Stack

*   Streamlit: For building the web application.
